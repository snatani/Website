            <h2>Education</h2>

In the past, I have twice interned at Adobe w/ Kalyan Sunkavalli, Vladimir Kim and at NVIDIA Research w/ Stan Birchfield . I have also worked as a staff researcher at UC San Diego School of Medicine with Fransisco Contijoch and was a visiting researcher in the Bio Robotics Lab with YU Haoyong at National University of Singapore.

I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science from UC San Diego and B.Eng. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani, where I was advised by Surekha Bhanot.

My research is supported by the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship 2023.</p>
